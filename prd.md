# 🌿 AgroGuard – Offline Plant Disease Detection System  
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 1. Product Overview

**Product Name:** AgroGuard  
**Platform:** Mobile Application (Android & iOS)  
**Mode:** Fully Offline  
**Category:** Agriculture | AI | Computer Vision  

AgroGuard is an offline mobile application that identifies plant/crop types and detects plant diseases using leaf images. It provides accurate treatment recommendations, including organic and chemical remedies, without requiring an internet connection.
